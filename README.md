### Project Overview

 Problem statement
Credit scoring algorithms, which make a guess at the probability of default, are the method banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted. This guided project requires Learners to improve on the state of the art in credit scoring, by predicting the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years.


### Learnings from the project

 This is an imbalanced data set so I learned to handle such a dataset with different methods. In this project applied the following concepts:

- train-test-split
- Handling missing values
- Standard scaler
- Logisitic Regression
- f1score,precisionscore,recall,confusion_matrix
- rocaucscore,rocaucplot
- SMOTE
- Random Forrest classifier
